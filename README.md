# Title: Public Data Auditing Scheme using RSA and Blockchain for Cloud Storage
With the widespread cloud storage devices, most users store
their data over cloud storage. A dishonest user might raise a false claim
about the integrity of their data to get compensation. On the other hand,
a corrupt Cloud Service Provider (CSP) might hide the fact from the user
that their data has been compromised. So, ensuring the integrity of the
data is of utmost importance in such cases. The integrity of user data
is ensured through Third Party Auditor (TPA), who is supposed to be
trusted and possess the computation resources to perform the auditing.
Although this TPA reduces the burden of verifying the data, thereâ€™s still
a risk of TPA, who may not be honest. The TPA might collude with the
CSP or not perform its task correctly. This paper proposes a Public Data
Auditing Scheme using RSA and Blockchain (PDASRSAB) for cloud
storage to bring security and transparency into the auditing process,
which increases confidence in cloud storage.
